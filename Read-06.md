## What is Node.js 
* I like this defintion:
    * Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library
* it was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute

* Ways to install:
    * use a version manager, as per this websites suggestion (?)
    * you can check the node in your computer using node -v
        * create a js file with a console log
        * the node fileYouCreated.js to see if it does the thing!
    * and many others, worth looking up, because the amount of info on this is too overwhelming to type in here

* advantages to node.js 
    * aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes
    * another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB)
    * JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point
        * this means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages
