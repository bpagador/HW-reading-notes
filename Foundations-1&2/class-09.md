## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
* forms communicate with servers, also may be stored in a database (uh oh, I smell a localStorage drawing near)
* the server than creates a new page to send back to the browser (double rainbow storage?!)
* < form > = form controls live here
* forms require action attributes
    * examples:
        * < input >
            * type=
                * "text"

                * "submit"
                * "email"
                * "url"
                * "search"
        * < textarea >
        * < select > = drop down list, also possible to select multiple
        * < button >
        * < label >
