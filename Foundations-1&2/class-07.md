## Domain Modeling
* object-oriented model = entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods
* assigning same attributes and behaviors to contained objects allows you for small and targeted changes to the algorithm

## Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)
* < table > = adds tables to a page
* < tr > = makes a row
* < td > = to create cells inside rows
* < th > = if the cell contains a header
* rowspan = makes multiple rows
* colspan = makes multiple columns
* for long tables you can split the table into a < thread >, < tbody >, and < tfoot >.

## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
* functions take parameters and return values
* a function attached to an object is a method
* a variable attached to an object is a property
