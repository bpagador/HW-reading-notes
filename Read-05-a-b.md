## Node.js for Beginners
* an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications
* written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform
* it's a server
```
var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
  response.write("It's alive!");
  response.end();
}).listen(3000);
```
* then terminal that bad boy:
    * node server.js
* the rest of the instructions are bit too complicated and I will need to have someone who can help me with it close by before I try it

## Problem Solving Skills
* open minded
* be inquisitive; look for:
    * things that seem odd or stand out
    * any patterns
    * anything that is there that maybe shouldn't be
    * anything that is missing
* questions to ask:
    * What is it actually doing?
    * How is it actually doing it?
    * How effectively is it performing its  purpose?
    * Why is it doing it/ what would happen if it was taken out?
    * What is it's relationship with other components?
    * What could I do to test that assumption?
* slow down, down panic, don't get lazy!
* follow the trail of the problem, find the root 

## Critical thinking  habits
* questions assumptions, ask for the receipts, and be kind about it because its not about calling out, its about solving problems together and growing from it
* reason through logic, really pick apart what you thought was true but might not be, did you miss anything?
* diversity and collaboration, people are and will continue to bring their own brilliance to the table, you are not alone, get your wolf pack, rely on them, allow the common goal to lead everyone, decentralize ego

## Asking better questions:
* personal creativity and organizational innovation rely on a willingness to seek out novel information
* questions and thoughtful answers foster smoother and more-effective interactions, they strengthen rapport and trust, and lead groups toward discovery
* we pose and respond to queries in the belief that the magic of a conversation will produce a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts
