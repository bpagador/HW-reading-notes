* links are created using a < a > < / a > tag
* relative link types function the same as we when we type the path to our directories in the terminal 
* email can also be linked using the < a > tag
* the target attribute allows us to tell the link how to open:
    * target = "_blank" opens the link in a new window

* at a glance call backs positioning flows:
    * position: static = normal 
    * position: relative = relative to where it would have been in normal flow
    * position : absolute = containers and elemenets no longer affect the positioning of other containers or elements on the page 
    * position : fixed = positining is relative to the browser and does not move regardless of other containers or elements 
    * z-index = when using relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, element have a potential of overlapping, z-index allows you to assign an index value to any element you want to to control/messes with your intended design
    * float = allows floating elements on the page 
    * clear = this property prevents overlap on whatever side you indicate

* liquid layouts allow for elements to stretch according to screen and resolution
    * liquid layouts use percentage 

* one can use a multitude of stylesheet, each corresponding to specific functions on the page 
    * each stylesheet needs importing
