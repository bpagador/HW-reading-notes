## What Google Learned from Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

* Key take-away quotes:
    * today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as "employee performance optimization" — isn’t enough.
    * software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems
    * unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers
    * Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.
    * On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. 
    * The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
    * "As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well," Woolley said. "But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined."
    * the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. 
    * Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like "conversational turn-taking" and "average social sensitivity" as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety 
    * If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I?
