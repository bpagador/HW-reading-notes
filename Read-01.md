## MDN (only read up to (but not including) "Nesting Templates") (Links to an external site.)
* template literals  = ${template literal}
    * always in backticks (``)
* to escape a backtick, put a backslash before the backtick
* template literals just make life easier and code cleaner when concatenating strings 

## CSS Tricks (don't need to read "Tagged Templates" or following section) (Links to an external site.)

* var myMultiString = 'Some text that I want\nOn two lines!';
    * the backslash renders the string on two lines 

## MDN forEach (Links to an external site.)
* callback: function to execute on each element. It accepts between one and three arguments:
    * currentValue: current element being processed in the array.
    * index(optional): the index currentValue in the array.
    * array (optional): the array forEach() was called upon.
* thisArg (optional): value to use as this when executing callback.
