## Concerned about your technical interview?
* Don't:
    * rush into coding right away
    * overcomplicate the solution 

* Do:
    1. read/look at the problem, at least twice!
        * if you don't understand the problem, you can't solve it, seriously invest the time in figuring out the problem domain
    2. before coding, solve the problem manually with dummy data and steps (break those steps down and identify the WHY)
        * remember code is just automation and "nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually"
    3. take this time to optimize the manual steps you're taking
        * ask yourself: could this one step be two steps? can I keep breaking this down into manageable pieces that will help my brain understand the solution?
    4. in the text-editor (vscode or the like), start writing those manual steps as comments or even pseudo-code
    5. replace the comments/fake code with real code
    6. now optimize the real code (refactor, destructure, etc.)
        * also remember someone is going to read your code, ask yourself: are all my naming conventions easy to follow and indicative of the steps I've taken to solve this?

* Pointers:
    * spend 70% of your time on steps 1-3 above
    * struggling in solving the problem is a sign you need to work on your computer language comprehension, you should know how to do the following things:
        * create a list
        * sort a list or array
        * create a map or dictionary
        * loop through a list, or dictionary
        * parse strings
        * convert from one data type to another 
        * ## IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS BEFORE AN INTERVIEW (POST GRADUATION), YOU MUST TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN THEM, THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL AND EXTREMELY HELPFUL 
    * confidence is a big part of remaining calm and collected and confidence in your coding skills only comes from practice, practice, practice 
        * check out codility.com; it's a tech recruiting site that makes code challenges and dives deep into what recruiters are looking for/expecting -- good perspective to have as you prep!

## Questions to ask yourself re: time management

* Am I focused or am I just "busy"? 
    * Focus can look like a lot of things, but typically it looks like the creation, execution and completion of actionable steps bringing you one step closer to a productive/rewarding goal
* What does "busy" mean and what power do I give to the word?
    * Really listing and breaking down the things the keep us "busy" allow us to identify the time-suckers, the things that can be consolidated, re-prioritized, or removed so that when we say we're "busy" we actually know by what, and by whom
* Who is in charge of my time?
    * The rule of thumb here is: you. Saying no to others can also be the opportunity to say yes to your own plans
* When I'm working/studying, is the time I'm spending on activity XYZ helping me reach a goal?
    * And if it is helping you reach your goal, investigate that further, HOW is it helping, could you apply that how/motivation to other tasks/activities you commit your time to
* Name activities/habits/actions that waste my time:
    * go ahead, do it!

## 4 Simple Steps to Effective Problem Solving 

* If you just started programming, you probably approach code like this:
    * try something
    * oops that didn't work
    * try something else
    * oops that didn't work, or kind of worked, wait, how did that work?
    * ## this is the cycle of ineffective code slinging, we've all done it and I'm here to tell you: it's no good 

* Ask yourself: what are the steps I usually take to problem solve aka what is my problem solving framework?

* If you came up with nothing, it's time to make one. Consider the following 4 simple steps:
    1. Understand
        - if you don't understand the problem, you will not be able to solve it
        - DO NOT JUMP INTO CODING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
    2. Plan
        - investigate/write down/comment what needs to happen to the code in order to solve the problem
        - DO NOT JUMP INTO CODING WITHOUT A PLAN
    3. Divide
        - break down the big problem in front of you into smaller "sub-problems" (meaning: small problems that can be solved without depending on other small problems being solved)
        - solving one sub-problem at a time means you can connect the dots of the sub-solutions to ultimately solve the larger, original problem domain!
    4. Debug
        - the bonus of solving big problems by breaking it down to sub-problems is that you can more easily pinpoint where code is broken, remember:
            - go step by step through the solution, follow the bouncing ball
            - take a step back, identify abstractions, simplify
            - you can always start from scratch, yes, for real
            - GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND, you can probably find that error message on stack overflow, you work on the internet after all!
    5. BONUS: PRACTICE
        - each new problem you meet teaches you something new about steps 1-4
        - stick to your approach, you can lean on it forever, at an interview, on the job, any time

## The Five WHYS and HOWS - A Technique for Problem Solving

* a method developed by Sakichi Toyoda:
    * "by repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear."
* this technique helps you drill down to the root cause by:
    * offering clarity about the problem 
    * meticulously unraveling a potential solution 
* this technique helps with:
    * problem solving
    * solution-focused, cause-effect brainstorming/diagram

* WHYs : investigates a problem by delving into the details of why this problem is persisting
    * example problem: Children are spending an excessive amount of time indoors and not engaging in nature enough
        1. Too much TV and video games -- WHY?
        2. Few community-sponsored recreation programs -- WHY?
        3. No family recreational activities -- WHY?
        4. No safe play area -- WHY?
        5. Lack of resources -- WHY?

* HOWs : breaks down potential solutions based on those WHYs and asks how we can make those solutions happen
    * using the above example:
        1. Less TV and video games -- HOW?
        2. More community-sponsored recreation programs -- HOW?
        3. More family recreational activities -- HOW?
        4. Safe play areas -- HOW?
        5. Additional resources -- HOW?
